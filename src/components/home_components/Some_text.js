                       Nova Gradiska was founded in the Baroque period, in the spirit of absolutist times, when towns with straight 
                       parallel streets, cut at right angles, with a spacious central square square around which churches and
                       public and private buildings were built all over Croatia. In its relatively short, but also rich past 
                       (the city is often referred to by historians as the youngest Croatian city), Nova Gradi≈°ka is by its historical
